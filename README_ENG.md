## 3. Project Overview
### 3-1. Background
- A service that creates a personal AI friend that talks and moves, based on drawings made by children themselves.
- With the age of smartphone use by children getting lower and the increase in dual-income families, we planned a service that creates friends for children.

### 3-2. Goals
- Entertainment: Provide joy through engaging user experiences.
- Social Skills Improvement: Serve as an AI buddy capable of communication and emotional exchange.
- Emotional Monitoring: Identify the child's interests and concerns through conversation-based analysis reports.
